# Rajan N 
Student at GIET vellore. Pursuing BTech-IT final year.<br>
**fields I am approaching:**  data science, data analytics, machine learning
<br><br>
### Current Project:    [check it out here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rajannnn/students-performance-analysis) <br>
Applying Multiple Linear Regression to find if students performance is influenced by these properties "_gender_","_ethnicity_","_parents education_","_lunch_" and "_test preparation_". Here are my findings so far, the above properties influence on their perfomance is significantly low. Maths performance stands out to be not predictable based on other score of skills.
